# MCP Server for EAI Services

This project implements an **MCP (Multi-Channel Platform) Server** that integrates with existing EAI (Enterprise Application Integration) services. It provides a set of tools and endpoints to interact with EAI’s SyncJobManagement and CommonService APIs, enabling secure, automated, and programmatic access to network reports and management features.

---

## Features

- **Fetch and Download Reports:**  
  Retrieve cable, segment, and ring reports from EAI’s SyncJobManagement and CommonService endpoints.
- **Secure Authentication:**  
  Uses basic authentication for secure API access.
- **Extensible Tools:**  
  Easily add new tools for additional EAI endpoints.
- **FastAPI-based Server:**  
  Built on FastAPI for high performance and easy deployment.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/)
- (Optional) SSL certificates for secure requests

Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or, if using `pyproject.toml`:
```sh
pip install .
```

---

## Usage

1. **Configure Authentication**  
   Update `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` in `server.py` with your EAI credentials.

2. **Run the Server**
   ```sh
   python server.py
   ```
   The server will start on `0.0.0.0:8000` by default.

3. **Available Tools**
   - `fetch_sync_job_management_report(report_name: str)`
   - `download_ring_report(mplsCloud: str)`

   These tools can be called via the MCP interface or extended as needed.

---

## Security

- **Credentials:**  
  Do not commit sensitive credentials to the repository.
- **SSL:**  
  Use the `certs/` directory for CA certificates if required by your environment.

---

## Extending

To add new tools/endpoints, define a new function in `server.py` and decorate it with `@mcp.tool()`.
